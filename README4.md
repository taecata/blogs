Every time I have started a project for this class the final product is completely different to what I first intended - more so than when I have used other mediums to create (painting, drawing, pottery). The reason for this, I think, is because I am also only learning how to code in p5 and I find myself with new functions at every moment I go onto the p5 website. Therefore, so far in my two projects, there have been great fluctuations in the original idea and what I actually create. I'll find myself discovering a new function, I'll try implement it, and then the sketch takes on a completely new form. When I have a more solid grasp on the functions that programming offers - like different sized paintbrushes - I think I'll have a clearer picture of how to make what I desire to make. But for now, my creations seem to come from a monstrous imagination or a monstrous implementation that only works by accepting its distortions. Therefore, I'd say that so far I feel not like I have little control over what my "drawings" result in which is quite fun as well because I've had strange shapes and compositions appear (although they are seldom aesthetically pleasing). I do not yet have a mastery of the tools for me to say that I can "let go". In my latest Babel project, I have started incorporating certain parameters but they are more conceptual than practical. What I mean by this is that in the Babel project I stuck with the general theme/message I was trying to construct, but while I was implementing my code the project modified itself in ways I did not except.  Some ideas just don't look very good when implemented, and sometimes a small "mistake" in the code makes something else jump out. In this way, the intended aesthetics are hard to stick to, but  - at this point - they eventually warp into something somewhat similar to what I had originally conceived.
