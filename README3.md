Chance operations artists

The first piece I will write about is "Predictive Art Bot" by the art collective Disnovation. The piece is made up of two screens, one on which there are images of current trending news articles, and on the other screen is the title for a proposal for a potential piece of art. The proposals are made up of words from current news headlines, all selected by a chance operation. The art collective insists on the collaboration of human and non-human actors in creating the piece itself, but also offering proposals for art pieces inspired by non-humans. I think that the piece has a certain uncanniness in the way the ridiculous (but possible) titles for art pieces resemble the news pieces that we are bombarded with daily.

The other piece I found is called "postcards from google maps" by the artist Clement Valla. Although the artists doesn't use a chance operation in the production of the work as something he made himself, the value of the piece does rely on a set of algorithms/computers/satellites that have in a sense "failed". Since we don't have access to many of the algorithms that affect our daily lives, I like this piece of "glitch art" because in a certain way the postcards reveal a sort of algorithmic unconscious. It also has an uncanny feel to it - in how close it appears to reality but reveals something off. The pieces also have a strong surrealist feel to them, and like the surrealism movement, the work resembles what Freud called "free association" with dreams and the unconscious.
