A Charge for Privacy is a very interesting data visualization piece that visualizes data in a way and in a moment where the viewer wouldn't expect. The installation is a phone-charging box that was set up in Miami Art Basel and that, as the viewer connects their phone, the machine will requests the person to give up some of their data on their phone. The data they ask permission for is access to the entire photo library on a phone, and - to make this worse, or more interesting - the legal ownership of that data. The beautiful part about the installation is the visualization of the data right in front of the eyes of the person who is charging their phone. The images are distorted and colorized in different ways, but nevertheless exist for public display for everyone watching the installation to see. Although it is not a data visualization per say, the data from your phone is directly visualized publically in ways that the viewer would never expect it to be. 

You may upload that data to Facebook, but you would rarely display it publically for strangers to see. Nevertheless, isn't that what Facebook (or other social media platforms) is at the end of the day? The artists making this piece, Branger_Briz, demonstrate how the line between giving away your data to Facebook or to this art collective is very blurred, and highlight how, although people may hesitate to agree to terms and conditions in this artistic space, not that many people would hesitate in their online daily lives. The labor to make this visualized data of this piece worthy comes from a collaboration between the artists and the user. The user gets a "free" phone charge at the cost of their immaterial labor of content production. 

Here is a video about the project: https://vimeo.com/34575655

This piece inspired what I want to do for my final project in the data visualization section in which I will download all of my Facebook data, but for myself (and self-knowledge) instead of for someone else. I want to create a visualization process that reveals something about myself, perhaps something I don't know that Facebook and its indexing might. I have 10 years' worth of data and metadata, so I think I could do something interesting with that. 

x.pose is another really interesting art piece relating to data. The piece coordinates all of the metadata created from your browsing/phone usage and links it up to a garment that you wear. As more data is collected, some of the previously opaque parts of the garment become translucent and transparent - revealing what was previously obscured. The very physical nudity becomes an allegory for the nudity of online life, and this very 'visceral' exposure again highlights the arbitrary areas of our life in which we value privacy and those in which we don't.

The last piece I want to discuss is not a data visualization at all, but it does speak to similar themes of privacy that the two works above don't. As you may see on the piece's website, it appears like a lab, or an Apple store. Instead, however, it was a live installation, by the Tactical Technology Collective, that mimicked a major "California-meets-cybernetics" company. In its actions, however, it was trying to execute a "data detoxification". The installation gives off dystopic vibes in that it consists of white polished aesthetics and "workers" who blend into the techno-utopian atmosphere that companies like Google and Apple give off. Nevertheless, the installation does this to accentuate the disparity between this and what they call our dark "digital shadows and data aggregates". The lab helpers actually tried to show the different ways in which data is collected and sold. In one of the stations, the lab helper discusses data and privacy to the participants quoting Mark Zuckerberg by saying our generation is one that leaves behind the concept of privacy. However, on the table at this part of the installation is a 3D printed model of his mansion and the acres of land around it that he keeps to encompass his privacy - highlighting the dark irony of his statement. The meticulously clean aesthetic is uncanny to the "dirtiness" of the work that the lab demonstrates.
