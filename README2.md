p5 has felt pretty good so far. The actual coding hasn't seemed too difficult, rather what I've struggled with is deciding what projects to pursue. When I took a computer science class last semester, there was always an end goal in the assignment and I just had to find a way to solve the problem. In this class, it feels like I am always more lenient with my "end goal", so I end up getting lost in what I decide to begin with and what I actually produce. On that note, I guess being creative has been the most challenging part of the class so far. I think in order to actually make some cool stuff during this class I have to try to stick to a specific goal to design, and try not deviate from that too much (at least during the next couple weeks) so that I can push through without changing what I want to design just because it seems too difficult a task! I also want to continue looking at more digital artists (especially people who may have their code open) so that I can inspire myself to see what work can actually be made with digital tools.
